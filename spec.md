## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the Zayora website from a tech products store to a clothing/apparel brand, updating all content, products, and visuals accordingly.

**Planned changes:**
- Update HeroSection tagline and description to reference fashion, style, and clothing instead of tech products, keeping brand name "ZAYORA" and founder "Yash Jaiswal"
- Replace tech product entries (earbuds, smartwatches) in the backend product catalog with at least 3 clothing items (t-shirt, jacket, kurta) including clothing-relevant features and image paths
- Update ProductCard and ProductShowcase to display clothing attributes (Material, Sizes Available, Style) instead of tech specs
- Update AnnouncementBanner promotional copy to reference fashion/clothing offers while keeping the scroll animation and countdown timer intact
- Update ProductReviews testimonials to mention clothing quality, fit, style, and delivery instead of tech products
- Add 3 new clothing product images as static assets referenced by the product catalog

**User-visible outcome:** The Zayora website displays as a clothing/apparel brand with fashion-themed hero content, clothing product listings with apparel-relevant details, fashion-focused reviews, and new product images for t-shirt, jacket, and kurta.
