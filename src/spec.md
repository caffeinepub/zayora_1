## Summary
**Goal:** Add WhatsApp order notification functionality to the checkout confirmation page.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a WhatsApp notification button to the OrderConfirmation component
- Button opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message containing order details (customer name, address, phone number, product name, MRP, delivery charge) to phone number 9919031626
- Use WhatsApp green color scheme and WhatsApp icon for the button
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility using WhatsApp web link format (wa.me)

**User-visible outcome:** After placing an order, customers will see a WhatsApp button on the confirmation page that allows them to send order details to the business phone number 9919031626 with a single click.
