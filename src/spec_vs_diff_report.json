  "summary": "The diff shows that REQ-32 has been fully implemented. The OrderConfirmation component now includes a WhatsApp notification button that opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message containing all required order details (customer name, address, phone, product name, MRP, delivery charge) to phone number 9919031626. The implementation uses the wa.me link format as constrained, and the button appears after successful order placement. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
