  "summary": "The diff implements all core requirements for adding a third product with e-commerce functionality. The backend includes product data models, order management system, and query methods. The frontend implements checkout flow, order confirmation, and dynamic product listing from backend. However, the specific product image requirement (white/light blue wireless earbuds) cannot be verified from the diff as image files are not included.",

The backend references '/assets/products/bluex1_earbuds.png' but no evidence of this file being added or the generated image directory being populated.",
