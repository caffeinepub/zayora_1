  "summary": "The diff implements most of the rebranding requirements. HeroSection, AnnouncementBanner, ProductReviews, ProductShowcase, and backend main.mo are all updated for clothing/apparel context. However, REQ-35 (ProductCard feature labels update) is not directly evidenced in the diff, and REQ-37 (actual clothing product image files) are not present in the diff as added files. The backend migration uses different product names (denim jacket, maxi dress, chinos) than the image files referenced in the build request (t-shirt, jacket, kurta), and the image paths in migration.mo do not match the required filenames.",

      "reason": "The diff summary mentions ProductCard.tsx displays 'clothing-relevant features with check icons' in frontend-file-summaries.txt but the actual ProductCard.tsx file content is not shown in the modified files list, so there is no direct code evidence of the feature label changes.",

      "reason": "No image files are listed as added files in the diff. The only added file is backend/migration.mo. The required image files (clothing-tshirt.dim_800x800.png, clothing-jacket.dim_800x800.png, clothing-kurta.dim_800x800.png) are absent.

      "reason": "The build request did not specify creating a migration.mo file or using a formal migration pattern. It only requested updating main.mo with clothing products. The product types and image paths also differ from what was specified.",
